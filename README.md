# ES106-Spirometer

A spirometer is an instrument used to measure the relative breathing capacity of the lungs. The design of the spirometer we have implemented is based on a freely rotating impeller mounted on a shaft which is then placed in a housing block. The aim of this project is to build totally different and unique Spirometer in terms of design and working procedure, has been made to check the capability of the breathing system.(Hardware + Software)

This project is done by one other memmber also. We have designed all parts in Autodesk Inventor and Fusion360 software--> got fabricated all parts in research lab-->assemble them-->used typical circuit to encode and decode input-output-->results on screen

We have learnt to use the C++ coding of different circuits like NodeMCU, Rotary Encoder, machinery of various devices for fabrication. We have used Ardiuno IDE (Integreted Development Environment) softwere.
